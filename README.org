* Cryptopals solutions in Emacs lisp (elisp)

This repository is a WIP for the [[https://cryptopals.com/][Cryptopals]] challenges.

Note: I only intend to do set 1 in Emacs lisp, and I may pick another language for the later challenges

** Motivation

No one has done the cryptopals challenges in Emacs lisp. There are cryptopals solutions (at leat for set 1) available in almost every language

** How to run

Run the ERT tests on the cryptopals solutions with the command

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
emacs -batch -l ert -l test-set-1.el -f ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit
#+END_SRC
